This repository contains the implementation for the paper:
**Optimal Interpolation-based Coordinate Descent Method for Variational Quantum Algorithms**

The experiments focus on the **TFIM** and **XXZ** models as described in the paper.

## Running the Code

To execute the code, please run the following commands in a Git Bash terminal:

```bash
bash run_tfim_HVA_Wiersema.py
bash run_QAOA_XXZ_Wiersema.py
```

These scripts perform numerical simulations of the **TFIM** and **XXZ** models using the proposed **Optimal Interpolation-based Coordinate Descent (OICD)** method.
