This repository contains the implementation for the paper:
**Interpolation-based coordinate descent method for parameterized quantum circuits** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04620

The experiments focus on the **MaxCut**, **TFIM** and **XXZ** models as described in the paper.

core packages:

```bash
qsiskit                       1.1.1
qiskit-aer                    0.15.1
qiskit-algorithms             0.3.1
qiskit-ibm-runtime            0.34.0
```

## Running the Code

To execute the code, please run the following commands in a Git Bash terminal:

```bash
bash run_tfim_HVA_Wiersema.sh
bash run_XXZ_HVA_Wiersema.sh
```

These scripts perform numerical simulations of the **TFIM** and **XXZ** models using the proposed **Interpolation-based Coordinate Descent (ICD)** method.
